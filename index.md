excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [Computational and Applied Mathematics group](https://cam.ornl.gov) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. <!-- ](https://www.ornl.gov). -->
<!-- under the supervision of Dr. Clayton Webster. -->
I am working in the group of professor Clayton Webster on several projects including *compressive sensing*, *machine learning* and *image processing*.
I am also contributing to the development of the FORTRAN module for the Toolkit for Adaptive Stochastic Modeling and Non-Intrusive ApproximatioN ([TASMANIAN](https://tasmanian.ornl.gov/index.html)).


I received my PhD in Computational Science from [Middle Tennessee State University](http://www.mtsu.edu/programs/computational-science-phd/index.php).
At MTSU, I worked under the supervision of professors Yuri Melnikov and Abdul Khaliq. <!--  at the department of Mathematical Sciences. -->
My [dissertation](http://jewlscholar.mtsu.edu/bitstream/handle/mtsu/5281/Reshniak_mtsu_0170E_10781.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) was devoted to the construction of the acceleration techniques for the multilevel Monte Carlo method in application to several classes of stochastic and random differential equations.
As a part of my master's degree in Thermal Physics, my previous research experience also includes computational mechanics and mathematical modeling of multiphase flows.
