<!-- I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [Computational and Applied Mathematics group](https://cam.ornl.gov) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
I am working in the group of professor Clayton Webster on several projects including *compressive sensing*, *machine learning* and *image processing*.
I am also contributing to the development of the FORTRAN module for the Toolkit for Adaptive Stochastic Modeling and Non-Intrusive ApproximatioN ([TASMANIAN](https://tasmanian.ornl.gov/index.html)).


I received my PhD in Computational Science from [Middle Tennessee State University](http://www.mtsu.edu/programs/computational-science-phd/index.php).
At MTSU, I worked under the supervision of professors Yuri Melnikov and Abdul Khaliq.
My [dissertation](http://jewlscholar.mtsu.edu/bitstream/handle/mtsu/5281/Reshniak_mtsu_0170E_10781.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) was devoted to the construction of the acceleration techniques for the multilevel Monte Carlo method in application to several classes of stochastic and random differential equations.
As a part of my master's degree in Thermal Physics, my previous research experience also includes computational mechanics and mathematical modeling of multiphase flows. -->

I am a staff mathematician in the [Data Analysis and Machine Learning Group](https://csmd.ornl.gov/group/data-analysis-and-ml) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

At MTSU, I worked under the supervision of professors Yuri Melnikov and Abdul Khaliq.
My [dissertation](http://jewlscholar.mtsu.edu/bitstream/handle/mtsu/5281/Reshniak_mtsu_0170E_10781.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) was devoted to the construction of the acceleration techniques for the multilevel Monte Carlo method in application to several classes of stochastic and random differential equations.
As a part of my master's degree in Thermal Physics, my previous research experience also includes computational mechanics and mathematical modeling of multiphase flows.

After graduating from MTSU in 2017 I started a postdoctoral position in the Computational and Applied Mathematics group at ORNL where I worked with Clayton Webster on several projects in compressed sensing, image processing and machine learning.

My current research at ORNL is primarily focused on the design and analysis of new robust machine learning and image processing algorithms.
